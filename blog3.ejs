                                                    learning. Online learning is completely
                                                    new for them and requires intensive work. They need a scheduled
                                                    planner to manage their time in an effective
                                                    manner. Online learning provides flexible time unlike traditional
                                                    classrooms. But some face difficulties
                                                    in adjusting to the time required for online learning.</p>

                                                <p>Students lack effective communication skills during online learning.
                                                    Teachers give assignments
                                                    for improving reading and writing skills but there is a possibility

                                                    assignments. There are some students

                                                    the new model of learning. It might
                                                    happen due to lack of interest, poor technological skills with apps
                                                    and video calls or unable to express
                                                    themselves via live chats, emails or text messages.</p>
                                                <h5><b>How to overcome the challenge?</b></h5>
                                                <p>To overcome this problem, 3-GB Education is offering O3
                                                    Education,i.e.,One-On-One Education. So, there will be
                                                    only one student and one tutor in the class and student can easily
                                                    interact and communicate. It will also increase
                                                    the productivity of Student.</p>

                                                <h4><b>Distraction</b></h4>
                                                <p>Learning from home is an amazing experience. You might expect things
                                                    around you to be like a school
                                                    campus. But at home things are different for example, you might want
                                                    a massive classroom, parks, playgrounds,
                                                    canteens, friends, teachers around you to guide and learn. But with
                                                    online learning, you have to manage
                                                    everything in one room with parents around you. You can be easily
                                                    distracted by small things at home. Also,
                                                    due to large strength in meetings, teachers are unable to pay their
                                                    attention on each and every student.
                                                </p>
                                                <h5><b>How to overcome the challenge?</b></h5>
                                                <p>You should inform your parents and friends about the time of online
                                                    learning so that there will be
                                                    no distractions from their side. Restrict the study area for others
                                                    to come during live sessions and
                                                    video calls. Make sure you relax in the breaks set in the time
                                                    table. With 3-GB Education, tutor can easily
                                                    pay attention and Learning will increase. </p>

                                                <h4><b>Feedback</b></h4>
                                                <p>Every student needs feedback for their performance during the
                                                    learning process so that they can improve
                                                    their learning abilities. They are not only observed during the
                                                    tests or exams but also for each assignment
                                                    and project. Research reveals that the students hardly visit their
                                                    assignments to check their suggestions
                                                    and comments. The feedback model with respect to online will be
                                                    difficult for them to understand and implement.
